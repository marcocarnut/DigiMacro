/* Updating a v2 board: the app above the core, written over the same vendor
 * report the rest of the page uses. The board's side is core/core.c; what
 * both sides agree on is core/layout.h.
 *
 * Nothing changes device, API or picker: the board stays the keyboard it was,
 * takes the new app half a page per report, and restarts into it. Two rules
 * the board taught the spike:
 *
 *   An answer counts only if it is to this question. The board has one report
 *   for everybody, so another program with it open -- the page in a second
 *   tab, say -- can ask between this one's question and its read of the
 *   answer.
 *
 *   A page is written when the flash, read back, holds it -- not when the
 *   board says so, since its saying so could be overwritten the same way.
 *   And the reading back is the wait: the board halts for each erase and
 *   write, a request that meets a halt fails, and failing fast is what lets
 *   this go without timers, which Chrome slows to a second in a tab that is
 *   not in front.
